abstract: "Theory predicts that the accumulation of sexually antagonistic loci and decreased recombination between proto-sex chromosomes results in sex chromosome differentiation. Therefore, it has been suggested that polygenic sex determination (PSD) may be an unstable intermediate in the evolutionary trajectory towards sex chromosome development. Presently, it is unclear how sexually antagonistic genes are distributed throughout the genome and how the nature of sex-biased expression in the absence of sex chromosomes differs in comparison to fixed sex chromosomal systems. Depite claims that PSD may be an intermediate stage, in the intertidal copepod *Tigriopus californicus* PSD is seemingly stable, thus providing a model for investigating sex-biased gene expression in the long-term absence of sex chromosomes. *T. californicus* sex determination is known to involve at least six loci on five different chromosomes in addition to a small environmental influence. Here, we use a microdissection approach to isolate male or female gonadal tissue from single *T. californicus* individuals. Total RNA was extracted from the gonads and carcasses of age-matched individuals and sequenced on two lanes of Illumina HiSeqX. We then compare the absolute expression between sexes and tissue to identify sex-biased transcripts and explore their chromosomal distribution. Further, genes with sex-biased expression were also investigated for overlap with candidate sex-determining QTL. Using sex-specific expression a higher resolution of candidate genes responsible for sex-determination is possible. This study is one of the first to highlight the nature of sex-biased gene expression in a species with PSD. A better understanding of sex-biased loci in the emerging *T. calfornicus* model will help illustrate the evolutionary implication of sex differences in systems lacking sex chromosomes."
