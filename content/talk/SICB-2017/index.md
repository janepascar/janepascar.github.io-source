abstract: "As more studies regarding host-microbe interaction are being published the trend shows just how much of an impact microbes can have on a host. Whether a microbe acts commensally, mutualistically, or pathogenically the impact that they have on the host species can exhibit a variety of effects. Specifically, one way that microbes can affect a host is through altering their sex-determination mechanism. Among arthropods one of the most widespread bacterial infections is *Wolbachia*. *Wolbachia* is transmitted vertically, directly from mother to offspring through the eggs, and is known to cause four different types of reproductive changes to its host species: feminization, cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis, and male-killing. In terrestrial isopods, feminization by *Wolbachia* is thought to skew sex ratios in favor females, but cytoplasmic incompatibility has also been observed. Both *Porcellio laevis* and *Trachelipus rathkei* follow the ZZ/ZW sex-chromosome determination system. Ultimately, feminization theoretically could lead to the loss of the W chromosome. To begin to understand the effects of *Wolbachia* infection in these two isopod species, we tested for the presence of *Wolbachia* using PCR. We are in the process of setting up crosses to further examine the effects of *Wolbachia* in these hosts."
