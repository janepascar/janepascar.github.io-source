I study the tripartite relationship between mosquito genetics, microbiome composition and *Plasmodium*, the protozoan parasite responsible for causing malaria. I am most interested in understanding and quantifying systemic differences in the microbiome between infected and uninfected individuals. To address these questions I use a combination of computational biology, biogeography, and microbial ecology.  

Currently, I am a PhD student in the Center for Reproductive Biology and I am advised by Steve Dorus.  

Prior to beginning my PhD, I recieved my BSc in Zoology from SUNY Oswego where I was advised by Chris Chandler. At Oswego, I studied reproductive endosymbiont genomics and sex-chromosome evolution in terrestrial isopods.   

Afterwards, I was a research technician at the University of Southern California under Suzanne Edmands where I assisted on a project exploring mito-nuclear interactions and sex-biased gene expression in intertidal copepods.
