<p>Writing your dissertation is already difficult, why make it more difficult by trying to format such a huge document in Microsoft Word? I have heard so many people spend <del>hours</del> <em>days</em> trying to format their dissertation work!</p>
<p>I still have quite a few years before I am at this step but I already know that formatting is going to be pretty low on my priorities, I would rather focus on the science! I’ve heard really good things about LaTeX.</p>
<p>None of my collegues that I know of use LaTeX so I envision I will only use it on papers where I am the sole author but my distain for Word formatting seems like a fair trade.</p>
<p>This article clearly lists the advantages: <a href="https://blog.typeset.io/the-only-latex-editor-guide-youll-need-in-2018-e63868fae027">The Only LaTeX Editor Guide You Will Need In 2019</a></p>

<h3>Learning by example.</h3>
<p>Many beginner guides to LaTeX I came across referenced the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX Wikibook</a>. I glanced through some of the pages, but honestly it contains so much information I was overwhelmed and eager to just start making documents. So, yes the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX Wikibook</a> is a very good source of information but it is definitely not required reading before getting started, <em>especially</em> if you already have a foundation in a coding language.</p>
<p>Feeling confident, I decided to convert my CV to LaTeX from Microsoft Word. I have spent an embarasingly large amount of time formatting my CV in word and I still don’t even really like it. Here is my <a href="../word_CV.pdf">old CV</a> that I’ve marked up with some of my gripes. To be fair some (most?) of these complaints are my fault but also Word makes it very difficult sometimes to do a simple task.</p>
<p>I browsed GitHub for some examples of CVs to pick out a design I liked that included all of the necessary source code.</p>
<p>Shoutout to <a href="https://www.posquit0.com/">Byungjin Park</a>, their repo <a href="https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV">Awesome-CV</a> has almost 10k stars and is pretty active through commits and pull requests. It is also just a really nicely designed CV.</p>
<p>However, I ended up choosing <a href="https://geoffboeing.com/">Geoff Boeing’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/gboeing/cv">academic CV</a> design.</p>
<p>I made a free Overleaf account and uploaded the .tex file from Geoff’s Github repo.</p>
<p>From there it was mostly just trial and error. Overleaf automatically compiled the .tex file so I could read through Geoff’s code and see how it translated to the PDF. Overleaf also has this really cool feature where if you double-click text in the PDF, the source code console will jump to where that part of the code is.</p>
<p>I didn’t change any of the formatting code like font family, alignment, font size, etc. But I did read through this part of the code until I more or less understood what was going on.</p>
<p>I essentially then just switched all of Geoff’s information with mine. He had a lot more sections that I needed so I would delete or comment out those parts of code. I rearranged the order of some sections and based on the already written code I made my own sections for outreach and mentoring service. I also rearranged some of his sections. For example, under Education I preferred to list the years of my degrees rather than their titles.</p>
<p>The most difficult part was making certain words bold or italicized. I’m still not exactly sure what the difference between \textit, \textbf, \it, \bf, or \emph is and I know I used them interchangably throughout my document ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯ but it at least looks the way I intended.</p>

<p>Here is my <a href="../pascar_cv.pdf">LaTeX CV</a>! I probably spent a few hours just messing around in Overleaf</p>
